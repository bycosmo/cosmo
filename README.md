# WCF - Web Component Framework

A framework of components that can help fill the "framework gap"

## Includes

- `@wcf/base`: A base element that all other WCF elements start from
- `@wcf/helmet`: An element to help manage what goes on in the head, inspired by react-helmet
- `@wcf/router`: A simple router/link prefetching solution

## Status

Very untested, initial stages

## TODO

- [ ] Global State management
- [ ] Mature into a proper framework a la [Enhance](https://enhance.dev) and [Astro](https://astro.build);
    - [ ] Page based routing
    - [ ] Bundling solution (likely Vite)
    - [ ] Images (and other assets)
