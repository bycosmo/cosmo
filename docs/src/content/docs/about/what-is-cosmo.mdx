<Blockquote>
The goal of Cosmo is to create a framework that can take snippets of HTML, CSS, and JS and compile them into CustomElements. Think if WebC married Astro.

## What Cosmo is:

- Cosmo is a base custom element with nice features to make working with Web Components/Custom Elements nicer
- Cosmo is an opinionated framework for making performant websites
- Cosmo is a collection of custom elements that can be used with or without the Cosmo framework

## What Cosmo is not:

- Cosmo is not backed by investors
- Cosmo is not going to replace existing meta-framework giants
- Cosmo is not looking for a better way to use React
