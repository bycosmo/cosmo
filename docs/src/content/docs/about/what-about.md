## Why should I use Cosmo instead of...?

It's fair to ask this question. Why bet on another meta framework when a new one is right around the corner? Why bet on a new one when a tried and tested one is already working for you? I don't have an answer for these questions. I can talk about the inspirations for Cosmo

### Astro

Let's face it, if you want to build a website with a ton of statically generated content and a smidgen of interactivity, your best bet and most pleasing experience is Astro. You can bring whatever framework you want to the table and sprinkle it in with their islands, add to that the new `server:defer` directive, you can ship incredible experiences to the user with 0 client-side JS.

The format of the `.cosmo` file is based directly on `.astro` files, though the compiler is custom built.

### WebC

If Astro is the framework with the best experience for building sites, WebC is the best way to interact with Web Components. It's so nice being able to use a Single File Component structure to describe what my component looks like and does, plus the multitude of other dx goodies that come along with it. With an emphasis on progressive enhancement and being run by the same guy who runs 11ty, it's a sure bet.

If you're just looking for a way to write web components that isn't a whole library/framework, you should just use WebC.

### Enhance

Never used it. But it seems like they have a similar goal to Cosmo.

### Lit SSR

If I used Lit before it was only for a moment. I couldn't tell you what makes Lit unique from other Web Component libraries other than to say "Isn't that the Google one?"

### What about {insert meta framework here}?

This field is expanding more rapidly with each day; I have no interest in covering the differences between Cosmo and your favorite meta framework.

Is it likely that some part of Cosmo will overlap with another meta framework/library/doohickey? Yes, and that's probably a good thing.
